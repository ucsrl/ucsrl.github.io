# Welcome to the official blog of [μCSRL](https://www.unibw.de/ucsrl-en)!

The [Munich Computer System Research Laboratory](https://www.unibw.de/ucsrl-en), μCSRL for short, is a new research lab at the [National Cyber Defense Research Institute CODE](https://www.unibw.de/code) at the [Universitaet der Bundeswehr, Munich](https://www.unibw.de), directed by Stefan Brunthaler.
This web page hosts all public artifacts of the research group, including blog posts, essays, source code, and tools.

## Research
As of Q2 2022, μCSRL conducts the following research projects.

### μ-fuzz
Bundles our research activities in automated vulnerability identification via *fuzzing*.
Our objective for this project is the investigation of combinatorial optimization of fuzzing on clusters.
To support this project, we have a state-of-the-art fuzzing cluster with 1,200+ CPUs.

### μ-proteus
Bundles our research activities in software diversification. Our recent milestones include:
- New defense against Address-Oblivious Code Reuse (AOCR) through novel diversification techniques that prevent the code harvesting stage of the attack.
- New defense against Counterfeit-Object Oriented Programming (COOP) through new spatial diversification techniques.

### μ-dc
We examine novel techniques in decompiling programs, i.e., the process of producing source code from programs in binary form.

### μ-python
Bundles our research activities in *interpreter optimization*.
Our present research efforts deal with purely-interpretative optimizations, i.e., trying to avoid dynamic code generation altogether.


## Essays
The following essays are available:
- [Triaging Boring Publications, a response to Daniel Lemire's post](essays/20210102-academic-ills.md)
